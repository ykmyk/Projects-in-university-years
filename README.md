Hello!
I am Yuka Miyake, 3rd year Japanese student in Charles University in Czech republic, majoring computer science.

Here is what I have done in my school years.

## /courseAssignment
In this respository, I stored the code I have wrote during my semester as an assignment.
It has following subrepository

Individual task has task specification (given by professor) and my solution code, test code(also provided by professor)

Each repository has task specification file so please take a look at it.
All codes are written in python but for GoogleColab style.
- NatureInspiredAlgorithm

Each repository has task specification file so please take a look at it.

## /courseProject
In this repository, I stored the codes I worked on as a semester project of some courses.
It has following subrepository with different coding language and each of them has own README.md file.

## /softwareProject_and_thesis
This is the repository for software project and thesis.
In my university, we first implement Individual Software Project, as a basement of the thesis, and we will do more academical resaerch for thesis based on / by using that software project.
I am planning to implement web application of 1 week meal plan as a software project.
After that, I will implement several optimization algorithm on the meal plan generation and do comparison research as my thesis.
The detail plan will be find in README.md file in this repository.
